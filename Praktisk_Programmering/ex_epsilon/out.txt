Part I i.
Maximal integer defined by the system 2147483647
My max integer with while = 2147483647
My max integer with for = 2147483647
My max integer with do while = 2147483647
All of these values are the same as expected

Part I ii
Minimal integer defined by the system -2147483648
My min integer with while = -2147483648
My min integer with for = -2147483648
My min integer with do while = -2147483648
All of these values are the same as expected

Part I iii
The mashine epsilon for a floating is = 1.19209e-07
My found mashine epsilon for a float using while is = 1.19209e-07
My found mashine epsilon for a float using for is = 1.19209e-07
My found mashine epsilon for a float using do-while is = 1.19209e-07

The mashine epsilon for a double is = 2.22045e-16
My found mashine epsilon for a double is = 2.22045e-16
My found mashine epsilon for a double using for is = 2.22045e-16
My found mashine epsilon for a double using do-while is = 2.22045e-16

The mashine epsilon for a long double is = 1.0842e-19
My found mashine epsilon for a long double is = 1.0842e-19
My found mashine epsilon for a long double using for is = 1.0842e-19
My found mashine epsilon for a long double using do-while is = 1.0842e-19

All of these values are found to be the expected.

The sum will run to the term numver of 715827882
The sum up float will hereby give = 15.4037
The sum down float will hereby give = 18.8079
The difference is due to the fact that the downwards sum will add small terms first, and after a long time be neglected 
In the upwards sum we will start with high sums and more quickly neglect the small terms

The sum of the reciprocal natural numbers to the maximal integer will converge, but not the sum to infinity which diverges. 

The sum up double will hereby give = 20.9662
The sum down double will hereby give = 20.9662
The sum now does not go to small enough terms to compare with the accuracy of the double 

We check if the function works by three tests one for tau, one for epsilon and one for negative
The first test which should give a 1 is 1
The second test which should give a 1 is 1
The third test which should give a 0 is 0
